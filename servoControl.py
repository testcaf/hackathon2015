# Send repeated pulses of an absolute duration (not a relative duty cycle)
# between 0.75 ms and 2.5 ms in duration.  A single pulse will only move it
# a short distance in the desired direction.  Repeated pulses will continue
# its movement and then once it arrives at the sprecified position, will
# instruct the motor to forcefully hold its position.

# First, know the pulse time for the position you want.

# a percentage.
